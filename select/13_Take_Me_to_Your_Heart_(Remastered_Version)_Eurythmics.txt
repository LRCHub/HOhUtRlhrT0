Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart

Time after time
I try to contact you
And time after time
I try to talk to you

But you don't take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart

When I'm alone
I think you're near me
It's good to pretend
That you're with me

Why don't you take me to your heart?
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart

Time after time
I try to contact you
And time after time
I try to talk to you

But you don't take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart

When I'm alone
It's good to pretend
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
It's good to pretend
Time after time
