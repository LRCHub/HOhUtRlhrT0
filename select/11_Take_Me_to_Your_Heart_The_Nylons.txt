Take me to your heart
Take me, take me
Take, take, take me to your heart
Take, take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart

Time after time
I try to contact you
Time after time
I try to be with you
But you won't take me to your heart

Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart

When I'm alone
I think you're near me
It's good to pretend
That you are with me
Why don't you take me to your heart?

Yeah, yeah, why?
Yeah, yeah, why?

Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart

Time after time
I try to contact you
Time after time
I try to talk to you
Why don't you take me to your heart?

Yeah, yeah, why?
Yeah, yeah, why?
Why, why?
Yeah, yeah, why don't you, why won't you
Take me to your heart?
Yeah, yeah, why don't you
Take me to your heart?

Take me to your heart
Woah, take me to your heart

When I'm alone
It's good to pretend
Time after time
Why don't you take me to your heart?

Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart
