Take me to your heart now, baby
Take me to your heart, come on, come on
I can't stop thinking about you
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart, come on

I must be dreaming
And my heart can't fight the feeling
'Coz when I saw you
I just knew what I'm missing

So how much time will it take
'Till we get to that day
So come on now
Heaven could be waiting

Take me to your heart now, baby
Take me to your heart, come on, come on
I can't stop thinking about you
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart, come on

Baby when you hold me
You really got me going
Oh what you do
You really move me baby

So how much time will it take
'Till we get to that day
So come on now
Heaven could be waiting

Take me to your heart now, baby
Take me to your heart, come on, come on
I can't stop thinking about you
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart, come on

So how much time will it take
'Till we get to that day
So come on now
Heaven could be waiting

Take me to your heart now, baby
Take me to your heart, come on, come on
I can't stop thinking about you
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heart, come on
